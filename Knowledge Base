CONCEPT DETAILS
──────────────────────────── 
• Introduction to Machine Learning  
  – This section introduces machine learning as a subfield of artificial intelligence that relies on statistical methods to “learn” from data without explicit programming. It frames the importance of data-driven approaches in modern computing.  
• Types of Machine Learning  
  – The document categorizes machine learning into three primary types:
    • Supervised Learning: where algorithms are trained using labeled data.
    • Unsupervised Learning: where algorithms work with data that lack explicit labels.
    • Reinforcement Learning: where learning occurs via trial and error with reward signals.
• Common Algorithms  
  – A list of algorithms is provided which includes:
    • Linear Regression
    • Decision Trees
    • Neural Networks
    • Support Vector Machines  
  – These represent foundational methods used to implement machine learning models.
• Applications  
  – Machine learning’s practical applications are highlighted in several areas:
    • Image and speech recognition
    • Medical diagnosis
    • Financial market analysis
    • Recommendation systems  
  – This indicates the wide industry relevance of the concepts being discussed .

KEY TERMS GLOSSARY
──────────────────────────── 
• Machine Learning: A branch of artificial intelligence focused on the development of algorithms that learn patterns from data, enabling computers to make informed decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed.
• Supervised Learning: A machine learning approach in which the algorithm is trained on data that is already labeled, meaning the outcome or category is known.
• Unsupervised Learning: A learning method where algorithms work with data that have no labels, identifying inherent structures or patterns within the dataset.
• Reinforcement Learning: A type of learning that involves an agent making decisions in an environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties to improve its performance over time.
• Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines: These are examples of algorithms; while the document does not define each in detail, they are widely recognized as fundamental techniques in the field of machine learning.
