KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:  
• Machine Learning: A field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to enable systems to gain knowledge from data.  
• Supervised Learning: A type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from a labeled dataset, meaning the input data is paired with the correct output.  
• Unsupervised Learning: A method where an algorithm analyzes and clusters unlabeled data, discovering inherent patterns without prior knowledge of outcomes.  
• Reinforcement Learning: A learning approach where algorithms learn optimal actions through trial and error by receiving rewards for correct actions.  
• Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines: Specific algorithmic methods used in machine learning, each with distinct processing approaches and use cases.
