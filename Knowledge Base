• Applications: Several practical applications are mentioned, including image and speech recognition, medical diagnosis, financial market analysis, and recommendation systems .

KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:  
• Supervised Learning: A type of machine learning where the model is trained on a dataset that includes input-output pairs, enabling the algorithm to predict outputs from new input data.  
• Unsupervised Learning: A machine learning technique where the model finds patterns or structure in data without any explicit guidance or labels.  
• Reinforcement Learning: This is an approach in which an algorithm learns to make decisions by receiving rewards or punishments based on its actions during trial and error processes.  
• Neural Networks: Computational models inspired by the human brain, used to recognize patterns and solve problems in machine learning tasks.
