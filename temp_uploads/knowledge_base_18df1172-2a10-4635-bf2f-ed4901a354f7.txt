KEY CONCEPTS:  
 • Machine Learning  
 • Types of Machine Learning  
 • Common Algorithms  
 • Applications

CONCEPT DETAILS:  
 • Machine Learning – Introduced as a field within artificial intelligence that employs statistical techniques to enable computers to learn from data without explicit programming.  
 • Types of Machine Learning – The document breaks this down into three approaches:  
  ○ Supervised Learning: Emphasizes training algorithms on labeled data.  
  ○ Unsupervised Learning: Involves training on unlabeled data to extract underlying patterns.  
  ○ Reinforcement Learning: Focuses on learning via trial and error by receiving rewards for correct actions.  
 • Common Algorithms – A list provided in the document includes Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines.  
 • Applications – Highlights the broad usage of machine learning in areas like image and speech recognition, medical diagnostics, financial market analysis, and recommendation systems.  
These details provide context and explanation for each key concept, making it clear how machine learning is positioned both as a theoretical framework and with practical implementations ().

KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:  
 • Machine Learning: A domain in artificial intelligence focused on developing algorithms that can learn and make decisions or predictions based on data.  
 • Supervised Learning: An ML approach where the algorithm is trained on a dataset that includes both the input and the desired output, allowing the model to learn from known examples.  
 • Unsupervised Learning: A method where the model learns to identify patterns and relationships in data that has no explicit instructions or labels.  
 • Reinforcement Learning: A branch of machine learning where models learn optimal behaviors through rewards and penalties based on actions taken during trial-and-error interactions.
