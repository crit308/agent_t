KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:  
• Machine Learning – A branch of artificial intelligence focused on developing algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.  
• Supervised Learning – A type of machine learning that uses labeled data to train algorithms so that they can predict outcomes for unseen data.  
• Unsupervised Learning – Involves training algorithms on data without labels, allowing the model to identify hidden patterns or groupings on its own.  
• Reinforcement Learning – A learning process where an algorithm learns to make a sequence of decisions by receiving rewards or penalties for actions during trial and error.  
• Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines – These are examples of common algorithms used in various machine learning tasks, each with its own method of processing data and learning patterns.
