CONCEPT DETAILS:
• Introduction to Machine Learning – The document opens with an explanation that machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence which relies on statistical techniques to empower computer systems to “learn” from data without being explicitly programmed.  
• Types of Machine Learning – The content divides machine learning into three primary categories:
  – Supervised Learning: Training algorithms on labeled data.  
  – Unsupervised Learning: Training on unlabeled data.  
  – Reinforcement Learning: Learning through trial and error with rewards for correct actions.  
• Common Algorithms – The document lists standard algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines, giving insight into the tools used in machine learning tasks.  
• Applications of Machine Learning – It identifies several application domains such as image and speech recognition, medical diagnosis, financial market analysis, and recommendation systems .

KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:
• Machine Learning: A field of artificial intelligence focused on enabling systems to learn from data by employing statistical techniques rather than being explicitly programmed.  
• Supervised Learning: A form of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a dataset that has labels, allowing it to learn the relationship between input and output.  
• Unsupervised Learning: A learning model where the algorithm is provided with unlabeled data and must identify patterns and relationships within it.  
• Reinforcement Learning: An approach in which an algorithm learns to make decisions by taking actions that maximize a notion of cumulative reward, often through trial and error.  
• Linear Regression: A basic and commonly used algorithm in machine learning that models the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables.  
• Decision Trees: A tree-like model used for making decisions or predictions by splitting data into branches based on feature values.  
• Neural Networks: Computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks, used to estimate or approximate functions that depend on a large number of inputs.  
• Support Vector Machines: Supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis.
