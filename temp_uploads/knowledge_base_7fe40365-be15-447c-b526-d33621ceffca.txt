CONCEPT DETAILS  
 • Introduction to Machine Learning: The document begins by defining machine learning as a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to enable systems to “learn” from data without being explicitly programmed.  
 • Types of Machine Learning: The text distinguishes three primary modes—Supervised Learning (training on labeled data), Unsupervised Learning (training on unlabeled data), and Reinforcement Learning (learning via trial and error with rewards).  
 • Common Algorithms: A list is provided that includes Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines, each representing widely used methods in the field.  
 • Applications: The document outlines several practical use cases of machine learning, such as in image and speech recognition, medical diagnosis, financial market analysis, and recommendation systems. 

KEY TERMS GLOSSARY  
 • Machine Learning: A field within artificial intelligence that equips computer systems with the ability to learn from data using statistical methods rather than explicit programming.  
 • Supervised Learning: A methodology where an algorithm is trained using labeled input data and corresponding output targets.  
 • Unsupervised Learning: A technique where the algorithm learns patterns from unlabeled data without any explicit outputs provided.  
 • Reinforcement Learning: A learning approach where an algorithm learns to make decisions by receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties during trial and error.  
 • Linear Regression: A statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation.  
 • Decision Trees: A flowchart-like model used for making decisions or classification by splitting data based on various decision rules.  
 • Neural Networks: Computational models inspired by the human brain that are used to recognize patterns and solve complex problems.  
 • Support Vector Machines: A set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression, and outliers detection.
