CONCEPT DETAILS  
 • Machine Learning is introduced as a branch of artificial intelligence that employs statistical techniques to empower computer systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  
 • The document breaks down the types of machine learning:  
  – Supervised Learning involves training on labeled data.  
  – Unsupervised Learning is based on unlabeled data, letting the system discern structure without direct guidance.  
  – Reinforcement Learning is described as a trial-and-error approach where systems learn through rewards.  
 • In its section on algorithms, the text lists common methods such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines.  
 • Additionally, applications are highlighted in fields like image and speech recognition, medical diagnosis, financial market analysis, and recommendation systems .

KEY TERMS GLOSSARY  
 • Machine Learning: A subfield of artificial intelligence focused on building systems that learn from data using statistical methods.  
 • Supervised Learning: A learning paradigm where models are trained on input data paired with correct output labels.  
 • Unsupervised Learning: A method where the system learns patterns in data without predefined labels.  
 • Reinforcement Learning: A technique where an agent learns to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties for actions taken in an environment.  
 • Linear Regression: A statistical method for predicting a continuous outcome based on input variables.  
 • Decision Trees: A model that uses a tree-like structure of decisions and their possible consequences.  
 • Neural Networks: Computational systems inspired by the structure of the human brain and designed for capturing complex patterns.  
 • Support Vector Machines: A set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression, and outliers detection .
