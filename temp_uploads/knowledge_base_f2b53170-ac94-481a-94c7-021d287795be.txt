KEY TERMS GLOSSARY  
 • Machine Learning: A branch of artificial intelligence focused on developing algorithms that allow computers to learn and make decisions based on data without requiring explicit programming instructions.  
 • Supervised Learning: A machine learning approach where algorithms are trained on labeled datasets, learning to predict output from input data.  
 • Unsupervised Learning: A method in which algorithms work with data that does not have labeled outcomes, aiming to identify inherent patterns or groupings.  
 • Reinforcement Learning: A type of learning where an algorithm learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to receive feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.  
 • Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines: These are examples of algorithms used to model data and solve problems in machine learning.
