CONCEPT DETAILS:  
• Machine Learning: Introduced as a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical methods so that computer systems “learn” from data without explicit programming.  
• Types of Machine Learning:  
  – Supervised Learning is described as training an algorithm using labeled data.  
  – Unsupervised Learning is characterized by training on data without labels.  
  – Reinforcement Learning focuses on learning through trial and error with rewards for correct actions.
• Common Machine Learning Algorithms:  
  – Lists include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines.
• Applications:  
  – The document highlights key application areas such as image and speech recognition, medical diagnosis, financial market analysis, and recommendation systems.  
Each of these sections is integrated into the document’s structure, helping the reader to quickly identify both the broad domain (machine learning) and its multiple facets .

KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:  
• Machine Learning: A branch of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to enable computers to learn from data.  
• Supervised Learning: A type of machine learning where algorithms learn from a dataset that contains both input data and corresponding labels.  
• Unsupervised Learning: The process of training an algorithm using data that has no labels, allowing the model to identify patterns on its own.  
• Reinforcement Learning: A learning method where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving rewards or penalties for those actions.
