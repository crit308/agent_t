CONCEPT DETAILS:  
• Introduction to Machine Learning: The file begins with an overview of machine learning, describing it as a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to “learn” from data without explicit programming.  
• Types of Machine Learning: The document categorizes machine learning into three main types:  
  – Supervised Learning: Where the algorithm trains on data with labels.  
  – Unsupervised Learning: Where the training data is unlabeled.  
  – Reinforcement Learning: Where the algorithm learns through trial and error, receiving rewards for correct actions.  
• Common Algorithms: A list of primary methods used in machine learning is provided, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines.  
• Applications of Machine Learning: The document describes various areas where machine learning is applied, such as image and speech recognition, medical diagnosis, financial market analysis, and recommendation systems.

KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:  
• Machine Learning: A branch of artificial intelligence involving algorithms that improve automatically through experience and data analysis.  
• Supervised Learning: A type of learning algorithm that is trained using labeled data, enabling it to map inputs to outputs accurately.  
• Unsupervised Learning: A learning method that uses unlabelled data, allowing the algorithm to identify inherent patterns or groupings.  
• Reinforcement Learning: A technique where agents learn optimal actions through rewards or penalties, refining their behavior over time.  
• Linear Regression: A statistical approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.  
• Decision Trees: A model represented as a tree structure, where each branch reflects a decision rule, leading to a conclusion or classification.  
• Neural Networks: Computational models inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process data.  
• Support Vector Machines: Supervised learning models used for classification and regression tasks by finding optimal decision boundaries.
