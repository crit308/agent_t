CONCEPT DETAILS:  
• The document introduces machine learning as a branch of artificial intelligence that leverages statistical techniques for learning from data without explicit programming.  
• It categorizes machine learning into three main types:
  – Supervised Learning, where the algorithm is trained on labeled data.
  – Unsupervised Learning, where the algorithm works with unlabeled data.
  – Reinforcement Learning, where the algorithm learns through trial and error, receiving feedback in the form of rewards.
• The document also outlines common algorithms, listing techniques such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines.  
• It briefly surveys the practical applications of these methods in various fields such as image and speech recognition, medical diagnosis, financial analysis, and recommendation systems. 

KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:  
• Machine Learning: A field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical methods to enable computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.  
• Supervised Learning: A type of machine learning where algorithms learn from labeled training data by mapping inputs to outputs.  
• Unsupervised Learning: A learning process that uses unlabeled data, allowing the algorithm to identify patterns on its own.  
• Reinforcement Learning: A method in which an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.  
• Linear Regression: A predictive analysis technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.  
• Decision Trees: A flowchart-like tree structure used for making decisions based on a series of tests on features.  
• Neural Networks: Computational models inspired by the human brain’s network of neurons; they are especially suited for pattern recognition tasks.  
• Support Vector Machines: A set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression, and outlier detection by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates data points.
