KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:
• Machine Learning: A field of artificial intelligence focused on designing systems that learn from data using statistical methods rather than explicit programming.
• Supervised Learning: A machine learning approach where the algorithm is trained on labeled data, meaning each input is paired with a correct output.
• Unsupervised Learning: An approach in which the algorithm trains on unlabeled data, seeking to find patterns or intrinsic structures in the input.
• Reinforcement Learning: A technique in which an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
• Linear Regression: A statistical method used in machine learning to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
• Decision Trees: A decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, widely used for classification and regression tasks.
• Neural Networks: Computing systems inspired by biological neural networks that are used to estimate or approximate functions that depend on a large number of inputs.
• Support Vector Machines: A set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression, and outlier detection.
