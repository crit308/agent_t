CONCEPT DETAILS:
• Introduction to Machine Learning: The document opens with a definition of machine learning, emphasizing its role as a branch of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to enable computers to learn from data without explicit programming. This sets the stage for the discussion that follows .
• Types of Machine Learning: The file outlines three approaches:
  - Supervised Learning: A method where the algorithm is trained on labeled data.
  - Unsupervised Learning: In which the algorithm is trained on unlabeled data.
  - Reinforcement Learning: Where learning is achieved by trial and error, with rewards provided for actions that lead to success.
• Common Algorithms: The document lists several algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines. Each represents key methodologies within machine learning theory.
• Applications: It highlights several practical applications, including image and speech recognition, medical diagnosis, financial market analysis, and recommendation systems.

KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:
• Machine Learning: A field in artificial intelligence focused on designing algorithms that enable computers to learn from and make decisions based on data.
• Supervised Learning: A learning method where the model is trained on a dataset that includes both the input and the desired output, allowing it to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.
• Unsupervised Learning: A method in which the algorithm discovers patterns in data without external labels, often used for clustering or dimensionality reduction.
• Reinforcement Learning: A computational approach where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving rewards or penalties, effectively learning policies over time.
• Linear Regression: A statistical approach that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear function.
• Decision Trees: A flowchart-like structure used for decision making that splits data into subsets based on feature value tests.
• Neural Networks: Computation models inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected layers of nodes that process information.
• Support Vector Machines (SVM): Supervised learning models that analyze data used for classification and regression by finding the hyperplane that best divides classes.
