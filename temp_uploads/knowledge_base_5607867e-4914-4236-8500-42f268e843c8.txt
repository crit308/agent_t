KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:  
• Machine Learning: A field of artificial intelligence that involves teaching computers to learn from data using statistical methods.  
• Supervised Learning: A type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from a dataset that includes input-output pairs, meaning the data is labeled.  
• Unsupervised Learning: A machine learning approach where the algorithm is provided with unlabeled data and must find patterns or structure within it.  
• Reinforcement Learning: An approach where an algorithm learns by interacting with an environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.  
• Linear Regression: A fundamental algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.  
• Decision Trees: A flowchart-like model used for making decisions based on a series of questions about the features of the data.  
• Neural Networks: Computational models inspired by the human brain, particularly useful for recognizing patterns and complex relationships.  
• Support Vector Machines: A set of supervised learning methods used for classification and regression by finding an optimal separating hyperplane .
