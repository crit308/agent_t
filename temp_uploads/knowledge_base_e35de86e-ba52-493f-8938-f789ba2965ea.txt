KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:
• Machine Learning: A field of artificial intelligence that employs statistical methods to allow computers to learn and make predictions from data without being explicitly programmed.
• Supervised Learning: A type of machine learning where algorithms are trained on labeled data to make future predictions.
• Unsupervised Learning: A method where algorithms analyze unlabeled data to find underlying patterns.
• Reinforcement Learning: A learning process in which an agent improves its performance through trial and error by receiving rewards or penalties.
• Linear Regression: A statistical method used to model and analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
• Decision Trees: A predictive modeling approach that uses a tree-like graph of decisions and their possible consequences.
• Neural Networks: Computing systems inspired by biological neural networks, fundamental to many machine learning applications.
