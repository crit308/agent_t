CONCEPT DETAILS:  
• Machine Learning: The document introduces machine learning as a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computer systems to learn from data through statistical techniques—with no need for explicit programming.  
• Types of Machine Learning: The file outlines three main types of machine learning:  
  - Supervised Learning: Where the algorithm is trained on labeled data.  
  - Unsupervised Learning: In which the algorithm is trained on unlabeled data.  
  - Reinforcement Learning: In which learning occurs through trial and error with rewards for correct actions.  
• Common Algorithms: Some of the standard methods listed include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines.  
• Applications: The content highlights key application areas such as image and speech recognition, medical diagnosis, financial market analysis, and recommendation systems .

KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:  
• Machine Learning: A field aimed at giving computer systems the capability to learn patterns from data, significantly reducing the need for direct programming.  
• Supervised Learning: A learning approach where the algorithm is provided with input-output pairs, so the system learns to infer a mapping from inputs to outputs.  
• Unsupervised Learning: This method involves learning patterns from data that are not labeled, extracting inherent structures without guidance.  
• Reinforcement Learning: A process where an agent learns optimal actions through interactions with an environment by receiving rewards for correct or desired outcomes.  
• Linear Regression: A statistical algorithm used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.  
• Decision Trees: A model that uses a tree-like structure to represent decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes.  
• Neural Networks: Computational models inspired by the human brain, capable of pattern recognition and learning from large amounts of data.  
• Support Vector Machines: A classification algorithm that finds the optimal separating hyperplane between different classes .
