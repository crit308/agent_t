• Types of Machine Learning – The document differentiates three main learning paradigms:
  o Supervised Learning: defined by learning from labeled data.
  o Unsupervised Learning: explained as learning from data that is not explicitly labeled.
  o Reinforcement Learning: a trial-and-error system where actions are rewarded to encourage correct decisions.
• Common Algorithms – The file lists fundamental techniques such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines, providing an overview of each method.
• Applications – It notes that machine learning is applied across diverse areas including image and speech recognition, medical diagnostics, financial market analysis, and recommendation systems. This illustrates both the breadth and depth of the topic as addressed in this sample document .

KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:
• Machine Learning: A field of artificial intelligence that utilizes statistical methods to enable computers to learn from and make predictions based on data.
• Supervised Learning: A learning approach in which algorithms are trained using pre-labeled data.
• Unsupervised Learning: An approach where algorithms infer patterns from data that has not been pre-labeled.
• Reinforcement Learning: A technique where learning is driven by rewards or penalties resulting from trial-and-error interactions.
• Linear Regression: A predictive algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear equation.
• Decision Trees: A model that uses a tree-like structure for decisions and their possible consequences.
• Neural Networks: Computational models inspired by the human brain, used for pattern recognition and classification.
• Support Vector Machines (SVM): A method that identifies an optimal hyperplane for classification or regression within feature space.
