CONCEPT DETAILS:  
• Machine Learning: The document serves as an introduction to machine learning, emphasizing its role as a field of artificial intelligence where computer systems learn from data using statistical techniques without explicit programming.  
• Types of Machine Learning: The text categorizes machine learning into several types. Supervised Learning is described as using labeled data, Unsupervised Learning involves using unlabeled data, and Reinforcement Learning is based on learning through trial and error with rewards for correct actions.  
• Common Algorithms: The document lists several algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines, outlining them as some of the foundational approaches in machine learning.  
• Applications: It highlights a range of application areas including image and speech recognition, medical diagnosis, financial market analysis, and recommendation systems ().

KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:  
• Supervised Learning: A type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on labeled data, meaning each input is paired with the correct output.  
• Unsupervised Learning: A paradigm where the algorithm works with unlabeled data, identifying patterns or groupings without predefined answers.  
• Reinforcement Learning: A learning technique in which an agent learns to make decisions through trial and error by receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.  
• Linear Regression: A statistical model that estimates the relationship between input variables and a continuous output by fitting a linear equation.  
• Decision Trees: A model that uses a tree-like structure of decisions and their possible consequences to help in making predictions.  
• Neural Networks: Computational models inspired by the human brain’s network of neurons, used to recognize patterns and solve complex problems.  
• Support Vector Machines: A type of classifier that separates data into different classes by finding the optimal boundary (or hyperplane) between them.
