• Applications of machine learning in areas such as image and speech recognition, medical diagnosis, financial market analysis, and recommendation systems

CONCEPT DETAILS:  
• Machine Learning is introduced as a branch of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to allow computer systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  
• Supervised Learning is described as a method where the algorithm is trained using labeled data, whereas Unsupervised Learning uses data that is not labeled. Reinforcement Learning is explained as a trial-and-error process where the algorithm learns by receiving rewards for correct actions.  
• The section further details common algorithms like Linear Regression for continuous predictions, Decision Trees for decision-making based on feature splits, Neural Networks inspired by biological systems, and Support Vector Machines that are used for both classification and regression tasks.  
• Additionally, the document outlines various applications where these machine learning methods are leveraged, ranging from visual and audio data analysis to predictive tasks in finance and healthcare .

KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:  
• Machine Learning: A field under artificial intelligence that employs statistical models and data-driven methods for automated learning and decision-making.  
• Supervised Learning: A type of machine learning where algorithms are trained on data that includes input-output pairs, meaning the desired outputs are provided.  
• Unsupervised Learning: A machine learning approach that involves training an algorithm on data that has no explicit labels, focusing on finding hidden structures within the input data.  
• Reinforcement Learning: An approach in which algorithms learn optimal behaviors through trial and error, driven by rewards for successful actions.  
• Linear Regression: A statistical technique used for predicting a continuous dependent variable based on one or more independent variables.
• Decision Trees: Algorithms that model decisions and their possible consequences by splitting data into branches based on feature values.
• Neural Networks: Computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains, used for approximating complex functions.
• Support Vector Machines: Algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis by defining an optimal hyperplane that segregates classes of data.
