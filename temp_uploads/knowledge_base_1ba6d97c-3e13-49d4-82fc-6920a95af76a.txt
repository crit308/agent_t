• Applications of Machine Learning

CONCEPT DETAILS:  
• Machine Learning: Introduced as a branch of artificial intelligence where statistical techniques enable computer systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  
• Types of Machine Learning: The document delineates three primary kinds—Supervised Learning (using labeled data), Unsupervised Learning (using unlabeled data), and Reinforcement Learning (learning by trial and error with reward feedback).  
• Common Algorithms: Examples include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines, which are fundamental to many machine learning applications.  
• Applications of Machine Learning: The document lists a variety of fields, such as image and speech recognition, medical diagnosis, financial market analysis, and recommendation systems, which illustrate the broad impact of these techniques.

KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:  
• Supervised Learning: A learning method where the algorithm is trained using input-output pairs, with the output labels guiding the learning process.  
• Unsupervised Learning: A technique that trains models using data that has not been labeled, allowing the algorithm to identify patterns and structures on its own.  
• Reinforcement Learning: An approach where an algorithm learns optimal behaviors through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties as feedback.  
• Linear Regression: A statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.  
• Decision Trees: A model that uses a tree-like structure of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes and resource costs.  
• Neural Networks: Computational models inspired by the human brain, composed of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information using connectionist approaches.  
• Support Vector Machines: A set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression, and outlier detection by finding the optimal hyperplane separating different classes.

FILE IDS:
