CONCEPT DETAILS:
• Introduction to Machine Learning – The document explains machine learning as a branch of artificial intelligence where computer systems use statistical techniques to learn from data rather than relying on explicit programming. ()
• Types of Machine Learning – It breaks down machine learning into:
  – Supervised Learning: where models are trained on carefully labeled data.
  – Unsupervised Learning: where models learn from unlabeled data.
  – Reinforcement Learning: where models learn via trial and error by receiving rewards for correct actions. ()
• Common Algorithms – The document lists several standard algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines.
• Applications – It highlights diverse fields of application such as image and speech recognition, medical diagnosis, financial market analysis, and recommendation systems.

KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:
• Machine Learning – A subset of artificial intelligence that leverages statistical methods to enable computers to improve their performance on tasks by learning from data.
• Supervised Learning – A learning paradigm where the algorithm is provided with input-output pairs and learns to map inputs to outputs.
• Unsupervised Learning – A technique where the algorithm seeks patterns or structure in data without any labeled guidance.
• Reinforcement Learning – A method where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
• Linear Regression – A statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
• Decision Trees – A model that uses a tree-like structure to model decisions and their possible consequences.
• Neural Networks – Computational models inspired by the human brain’s network structure, used in deep learning.
• Support Vector Machines – A set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression, and outlier detection.
