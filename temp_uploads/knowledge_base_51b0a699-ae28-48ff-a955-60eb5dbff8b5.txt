CONCEPT DETAILS:
 • Introduction to Machine Learning: The document introduces machine learning as a major branch of artificial intelligence that employs statistical techniques so that systems can learn from data without explicit programming.  
 • Types of Machine Learning: It distinguishes three primary categories:  
  – Supervised Learning: where algorithms learn from labeled data;  
  – Unsupervised Learning: where data lack labels;  
  – Reinforcement Learning: where learning is achieved via trial and error with rewards.  
 • Common Algorithms: The document lists algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines as central tools in the field.  
 • Applications: It highlights various real-world domains including image and speech recognition, medical diagnosis, financial market analysis, and recommendation systems .

KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:
 • Machine Learning: A field of artificial intelligence dedicated to developing algorithms that improve automatically through experience and data analysis.  
 • Supervised Learning: A machine learning paradigm where the model is trained using input-output pairs with known outcomes.  
 • Unsupervised Learning: Techniques where the model finds patterns and relationships in data that is not pre-labeled.  
 • Reinforcement Learning: An approach where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions and receiving rewards or penalties.  
 • Neural Networks: Computational models inspired by biological neural networks used to recognize patterns and interpret sensory data.  
 • Decision Trees and Linear Regression: Classic algorithmic approaches respectively useful for classification and prediction tasks.
