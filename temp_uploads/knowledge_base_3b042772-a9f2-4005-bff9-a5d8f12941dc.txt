KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:
 • Machine Learning: A branch of artificial intelligence focused on building systems that can learn from data.
 • Supervised Learning: A method where the algorithm is trained using input-output pairs (labeled data).
 • Unsupervised Learning: A learning approach where the algorithm identifies patterns in a dataset that lacks labels.
 • Reinforcement Learning: An algorithmic approach where agents learn optimal behaviors through rewards and penalties based on actions.
 • Linear Regression: A statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
 • Decision Trees: A model that splits data into branches to make predictions based on decision rules.
 • Neural Networks: Computational models inspired by the interconnected network of neurons in the brain, used for pattern recognition and forecasting.
 • Support Vector Machines: A set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression, and outlier detection.
