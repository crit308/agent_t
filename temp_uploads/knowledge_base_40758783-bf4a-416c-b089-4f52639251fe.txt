KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:  
• Machine Learning: A branch of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to allow computer systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.  
• Supervised Learning: A type of machine learning where the algorithm is provided with labeled data for training, enabling it to make predictions or classifications.  
• Unsupervised Learning: An approach where the algorithm identifies patterns in data that isn’t labeled and organizes the information based solely on the input data characteristics.  
• Reinforcement Learning: A learning technique where an algorithm learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving rewards or penalties for those actions, thereby improving its performance over time.  
• Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines: These are examples of specific algorithms used within machine learning for tasks such as prediction, classification, and pattern recognition.
