KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:  
• Machine Learning – A field of artificial intelligence that enables computer systems to learn directly from data without explicit programming.  
• Supervised Learning – A type of learning where models are trained using data sets that have been labeled with the correct answers.  
• Unsupervised Learning – A method in which models learn patterns from data that have not been pre-classified or labeled.  
• Reinforcement Learning – A type of machine learning where an algorithm learns by interacting with its environment; receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.  
• Neural Networks – Computational models inspired by the human brain’s networks, used for recognizing patterns and decision-making.  
• Support Vector Machines – Supervised learning models that analyze data for classification and regression analysis.
