KEY CONCEPTS:
1. Machine Learning  
  The document provides an overview of machine learning, describing it as a field within artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data rather than being explicitly programmed.  
2. Types of Machine Learning  
  The text discusses three main types:  
  • Supervised Learning – where learning happens on labeled data  
  • Unsupervised Learning – where the system works with unlabeled data  
  • Reinforcement Learning – where the approach is based on reward and trial-and-error  
3. Common Algorithms  
  It mentions several algorithms as standard tools in machine learning, highlighting methods such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines.  
4. Applications  
  The document also lists practical areas where machine learning has been applied; for example, image and speech recognition, medical diagnosis, financial market analysis, and recommendation systems .

CONCEPT DETAILS:
• Machine Learning: Introduced as a technical field aimed at enabling computers to evolve through data-driven insights without explicit reprogramming.  
• Types of Machine Learning:  
  – Supervised Learning is outlined as the process of training algorithms on data that has been labeled for outcomes.  
  – Unsupervised Learning focuses on discovering hidden structures in unlabeled data.  
  – Reinforcement Learning emphasizes learning strategies based on rewards and penalties through interactions with the environment.  
• Common Algorithms: Specific algorithms (Linear Regression for numeric prediction, Decision Trees for classification, Neural Networks as computational models inspired by biological brains, and Support Vector Machines for pattern recognition) are enumerated as core methods used in practice.  
• Applications: The concepts tie into real-world scenarios, demonstrating how theory is applied in tasks such as recognition systems, diagnostic tools in healthcare, financial predictions, and personalized recommendations.

KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:
• Machine Learning: A branch of artificial intelligence that develops algorithms capable of learning from and making predictions or decisions based on data.
• Supervised Learning: A type of learning where the algorithm is provided with example inputs and their corresponding outputs, guiding future predictions.
• Unsupervised Learning: An approach where the algorithm seeks to identify patterns or groupings in data without any labeled responses.
• Reinforcement Learning: A method where an agent learns to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties, iterating through trial-and-error.
• Linear Regression: A statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
• Decision Trees: A model that uses a tree-like structure of decisions and their possible consequences, used for classification and regression tasks.
• Neural Networks: Computational models inspired by the biological neural systems, used primarily to recognize patterns and perform complex tasks.
• Support Vector Machines: A set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression, and outlier detection.
