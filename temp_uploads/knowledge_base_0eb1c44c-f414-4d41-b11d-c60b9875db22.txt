KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:
 • Machine Learning: A branch of artificial intelligence that employs statistical methods to enable systems to improve with experience by learning from data.
 • Supervised Learning: A type of learning where algorithms are trained using labeled data, guiding the system to predict outcomes based on known results.
 • Unsupervised Learning: A learning paradigm where algorithms work with unlabeled data to deduce the underlying structure without explicit guidance.
 • Reinforcement Learning: A method where an algorithm learns optimal actions through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.
 • Linear Regression: A predictive statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
 • Decision Trees: A model that breaks down a dataset into smaller subsets while developing an associated decision tree incrementally.
 • Neural Networks: Computational models inspired by the human brain that are used for pattern recognition and signal processing.
 • Support Vector Machines: A supervised learning method used for classification and regression challenges, effective in high-dimensional spaces.
