CONCEPT DETAILS:
 • Introduction to Machine Learning – The document begins by explaining that machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence which utilizes statistical techniques to enable systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  
 • Types of Machine Learning – It categorizes machine learning into three primary types:  
  – Supervised Learning: where the algorithm is trained on labeled data.  
  – Unsupervised Learning: where the algorithm learns from unlabeled data.  
  – Reinforcement Learning: where learning occurs through trial and error, with the system receiving rewards for correct actions.  
 • Common Algorithms – The text lists prominent algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines.  
 • Applications – It outlines various fields of application including image and speech recognition, medical diagnosis, financial market analysis, and recommendation systems ().

KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:
 • Machine Learning: An area of artificial intelligence that applies statistical methods to enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time.  
 • Supervised Learning: A method where algorithms are provided with input-output pairs, allowing them to learn from labeled data.  
 • Unsupervised Learning: A learning technique that uses data without labeled responses to find underlying patterns or groupings.  
 • Reinforcement Learning: A type of learning where an algorithm develops strategies based on a system of rewards and penalties from interactions with its environment.  
 • Linear Regression: A statistical approach to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.  
 • Decision Trees: A model that uses a tree-like graph of decisions and their possible consequences to predict outcomes.  
 • Neural Networks: Computational models inspired by the human brain, used to recognize patterns and classify information.  
 • Support Vector Machines: Supervised learning models that analyze data for classification and regression by finding optimal boundaries between classes ().
