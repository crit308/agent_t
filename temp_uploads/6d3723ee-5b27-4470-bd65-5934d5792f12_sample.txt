# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" from data, without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

- **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm is trained on labeled data.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm is trained on unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns through trial and error, receiving rewards for correct actions.

## Common Algorithms

1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Trees
3. Neural Networks
4. Support Vector Machines

## Applications

Machine learning is used in many fields:
- Image and speech recognition
- Medical diagnosis
- Financial market analysis
- Recommendation systems
