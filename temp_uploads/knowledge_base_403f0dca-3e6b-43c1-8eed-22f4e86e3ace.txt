KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:  
• Machine Learning: A branch of artificial intelligence focused on developing methods that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.  
• Supervised Learning: A type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained using a dataset that includes the desired output.  
• Unsupervised Learning: A type of machine learning that uses data without labeled responses, aiming to find patterns or intrinsic structures.  
• Reinforcement Learning: An area of machine learning in which an agent learns to behave in an environment by performing actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards.  
• Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines: Specific algorithms highlighted as common strategies used within machine learning frameworks.
