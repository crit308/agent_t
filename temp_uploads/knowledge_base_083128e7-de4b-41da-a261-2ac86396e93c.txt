KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:
• Machine Learning – A branch of artificial intelligence focusing on the development of algorithms that enable computers to learn patterns from data.  
• Supervised Learning – A type of machine learning where models are trained using data that has been clearly labeled with the correct answers.  
• Unsupervised Learning – A machine learning approach involving the analysis of unlabeled data to uncover hidden patterns or intrinsic structures.  
• Reinforcement Learning – A method where an algorithm learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.  
• Linear Regression – A statistical technique used to model and analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.  
• Decision Trees – A model that uses a tree-like graph of decisions and their possible consequences to solve classification or regression problems.  
• Neural Networks – Computational models inspired by the human brain, which are used to recognize patterns and solve complex problems.  
• Support Vector Machines – Supervised learning models particularly effective for classification tasks that work by finding the hyperplane that best separates classes in the feature space.
