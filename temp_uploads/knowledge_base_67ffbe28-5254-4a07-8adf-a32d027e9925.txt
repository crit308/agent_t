KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:
• Artificial Intelligence (AI): A broad field in computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence.  
• Machine Learning: A branch of AI that uses statistical techniques to enable computer systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed for each task.  
• Supervised Learning: A type of machine learning where models are trained on input-output pairs (labeled data) so that they can predict outcomes for new inputs.  
• Unsupervised Learning: A machine learning approach where algorithms analyze unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures.  
• Reinforcement Learning: A method in which an algorithm learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.  
• Linear Regression: A statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.  
• Decision Trees: A model that uses a tree-like graph of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes and resource costs.  
• Neural Networks: Computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks present in animal brains, used primarily to recognize patterns and solve complex problems.  
• Support Vector Machines (SVM): A supervised learning algorithm used primarily for classification tasks by finding the hyperplane that best divides a dataset into classes .
