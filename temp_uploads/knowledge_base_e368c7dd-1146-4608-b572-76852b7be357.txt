KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:  
• Machine Learning: A branch of artificial intelligence focused on creating algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make decisions based on data without being explicitly programmed.  
• Supervised Learning: A machine learning approach that relies on labeled data to train algorithms for tasks such as classification and prediction.  
• Unsupervised Learning: A technique where algorithms analyze and group data based on inherent structures found in unlabeled datasets.  
• Reinforcement Learning: A learning method in which an algorithm learns to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties, thereby improving its performance over time.  
• Linear Regression: A statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables in order to predict continuous outcomes.  
• Decision Trees: A model that uses a branching method to illustrate every possible outcome of a decision or series of decisions.  
• Neural Networks: Computational models designed to simulate the way a human brain analyzes and processes information through interconnected nodes.  
• Support Vector Machines: A supervised learning model that analyzes data for classification and regression analysis by finding the optimal hyperplane separating different classes .
