CONCEPT DETAILS:
• Machine Learning: The document introduces machine learning as a subfield of artificial intelligence which uses statistical techniques to enable computer systems to learn from data without explicit programming .
• Types of Machine Learning: It categorizes machine learning into three major types:
  - Supervised Learning: Involves training algorithms on labeled data.
  - Unsupervised Learning: Deals with data without labels.
  - Reinforcement Learning: Focuses on learning through a system of rewards based on trial and error.
• Common Algorithms: The text lists several algorithms frequently used in the field, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines .
• Applications: It highlights various domains where machine learning has been applied effectively, such as image and speech recognition, medical diagnosis, financial market analysis, and recommendation systems.

KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:
• Machine Learning – A field in artificial intelligence that uses statistical methods to allow systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
• Supervised Learning – A type of machine learning where the algorithm is provided with labeled input and output data.
• Unsupervised Learning – A machine learning method involving data that is not labeled, where the system learns inherent structures from the input.
• Reinforcement Learning – A learning paradigm in which an algorithm learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
• Linear Regression – An algorithm used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more explanatory variables.
• Decision Trees – A model that uses a tree-like graph of decisions and their possible consequences.
• Neural Networks – Computational models inspired by the human brain that are used to approximate functions and recognize patterns.
• Support Vector Machines – A set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression, and outlier detection.
