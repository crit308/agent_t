KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:
• Machine Learning: A branch of artificial intelligence that employs statistical methods to allow computers to learn from data and improve from experience.
• Supervised Learning: A machine learning method that uses labeled datasets to train algorithms, enabling them to predict outcomes accurately.
• Unsupervised Learning: A method where algorithms analyze and cluster data without predefined labels, uncovering hidden patterns.
• Reinforcement Learning: A type of learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving rewards or penalties.
• Linear Regression: A statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
• Decision Trees: A model that splits data into branches to represent decision paths, commonly used for classification and regression.
• Neural Networks: Computing structures modeled after the human brain’s network, often used in deep learning applications.
• Support Vector Machines: Supervised learning models used primarily for classification, which find the optimal boundary between possible outputs.
