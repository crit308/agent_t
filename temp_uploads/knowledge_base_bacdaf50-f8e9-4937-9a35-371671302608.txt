CONCEPT DETAILS:
• The document starts with an Introduction to Machine Learning, defining it as a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques. It emphasizes that machine learning enables computer systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed .
• It then explains the Types of Machine Learning, breaking them into distinct categories:  
 – Supervised Learning: Where the algorithm is trained on labeled data.  
 – Unsupervised Learning: Where the algorithm works with unlabeled data.  
 – Reinforcement Learning: Where learning occurs through trial and error with rewards .
• Under Common Algorithms, the document lists key methods such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines, each highlighting a typical approach within machine learning .
• Finally, the Applications section outlines several practical uses of machine learning, including image and speech recognition, medical diagnosis, financial market analysis, and recommendation systems .

KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:
• Machine Learning: A branch of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to enable systems to learn from data and make decisions or predictions.  
• Supervised Learning: A methodological approach where models are trained on labeled datasets to predict outcomes accurately.  
• Unsupervised Learning: A technique in which algorithms analyze and cluster unlabeled data to identify patterns.  
• Reinforcement Learning: An approach where agents learn optimal behavior through trial-and-error interactions with an environment, receiving rewards for successful actions.  
• Linear Regression: A fundamental statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.  
• Decision Trees: A model that uses a tree-like graph of decisions and their possible consequences to classify or predict outcomes.  
• Neural Networks: Computational models inspired by the human brain’s architecture, used especially for pattern recognition and complex decision-making.  
• Support Vector Machines: A group of supervised learning methods used for classification and regression tasks by finding the optimal hyperplane separating data classes.
