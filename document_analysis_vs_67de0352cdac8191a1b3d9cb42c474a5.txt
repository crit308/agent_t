CONCEPT DETAILS:  
• The “Introduction to Machine Learning” section sets the context, explaining that machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that leverages statistical methods to empower systems to learn without explicit programming.  
• In the “Types of Machine Learning” section, the document distinguishes between supervised (using labeled data), unsupervised (using unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning by receiving rewards), thereby laying the foundation for understanding different approaches.  
• “Common Algorithms” provides concrete examples of methods that are often employed in the field. These include Linear Regression for predicting continuous values, Decision Trees for classification and regression tasks, Neural Networks inspired by the human brain, and Support Vector Machines known for effective classification, each representing a key mechanism in algorithmic data processing.  
• Finally, the “Applications” section reveals real-world uses that underscore how machine learning plays a crucial role in industries like healthcare, finance, and technology .

KEY TERMS GLOSSARY:  
• Machine Learning: A field of artificial intelligence focused on building systems that learn from data using statistical techniques, rather than following strictly static program instructions.  
• Supervised Learning: A type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained using labeled data, which means that each training example is paired with an output label.  
• Unsupervised Learning: A branch of machine learning that deals with unlabeled data, aiming to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data to learn more about it.  
• Reinforcement Learning: A learning paradigm where an algorithm learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving rewards or penalties for the outcomes.  
• Linear Regression: A fundamental algorithm used to model the relationship between a scalar dependent variable and one or more explanatory variables by fitting a linear equation.  
• Decision Trees: A predictive model that maps observations about data to conclusions about its target value, structured like a tree with decision points.  
• Neural Networks: Computational models inspired by the human brain, widely used for recognizing patterns and solving complex tasks by learning from data inputs.  
• Support Vector Machines: A classification algorithm that finds the hyperplane which best separates different classes of data, known for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces.
